# Tokens

## Why create our own web token?

- JWT has ~ a billion features, building our own simpler one lets us explore expected features ~~more lazily~~ with a discerning eye on what's essential

<!-- probably you're not going to use all the features! it's unlikely if you're reading up on JWTs you'll immediately jump into
nested asymmetrically encrypted signed JWTs with every optional header field, so starting with something smaller can give a nice view
of token mechanics without delving into every "this is mostly true except when..." -->

- using JWTs veers off into Java crypto APIs unless the people producing the JWT agree with the exact opinions of your library,
  so we may as well get used to it
- so much token stuff around the internet is in JavaScript and it's good to do token-y work sometimes with ~~better~~ different tools

---

## Some properties of "web tokens"

- web: should be URL safe, not be so huge that you care about it for bandwidth
- token: should be some kind of magic random string looking thing, not meaningful on its own

<!-- tokens are kind of "I know it when I see it" to an extent -- there isn't as far as I know a general spec for
"x can be a token"; it's just "the special bytes that the server knows how to care about for token-y reasons" -->

---

## Some tokens

- secret
- All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
- üòéüéâüö©üêªüéØ
- more familiar tokens like:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJzdWIiOiJhYmprbHNqZGZsa2EiLCJuYW1lIjoiSmFtZXMgUyIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.
lFwutwLbDjwqKAJ0B_zrELX2lqomMeYzKINs9zQBNmI
```
- maybe this surfing cat

---

## What other properties would be nice?

- `*waves hands*` _meaningful_
- verifiable validity
- safe from prying eyes
- extensible

---

## Pursuing token properties

- meaningfulness: represent data from authentication / authorization domain in the token

<!-- (i.e. "userId=james", not "üòéüéâüö©üêªüéØ") -->

- validity: it should be possible to prove a token is a good token with (mostly) data contained in the token
- security: data represented in the token should be legible only to its intended recipients
- extensible: I should be able to add to the data representable in the token at some later time

### Meaningfulness

- going to build a serialization format from scratch that's very simple

```scala mdoc:silent
sealed abstract class UserRole(repr: String) {
  override def toString(): String = repr
}

case object Admin extends UserRole("admin")
case object VanillaUser extends UserRole("vanilla")

case class AuthInfo(role: UserRole, x: Int, y: String, z: List[Int])
val authInfo = AuthInfo(VanillaUser, 3, "abc", List(3, 4, 5))
// => serialization goal is: x=3;y="abc";z=[3,4,5]
```

<!-- x / y / z are like arbitrary metadata that we need to include with our auth info,
role is meaningful to the application somehow -->

- then Deflate it to make it small
- then base64 encode it to make it look nice and token-y

---

### Meaningfulness
```scala mdoc:invisible
import cats.data.{Validated, ValidatedNel}
import cats.parse.Parser
import cats.parse.Rfc5234._
import cats.Show
import cats.syntax.all._
import shapeless.{HList, HNil, LabelledGeneric, Lazy, Witness, :: }
import shapeless.labelled
import shapeless.labelled.FieldType
import shapeless.syntax.singleton._

import javax.crypto.{Cipher, Mac}
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets
import java.security.{KeyPairGenerator, PrivateKey, PublicKey}
import java.util.Base64
import java.util.zip.{Deflater, Inflater}
```

```scala mdoc:silent
trait BSEncoder[A] {
  def encode(a: A): String
}
```

<!-- again, we don't really have strong boundaries we can put around what a token is --
this typeclass says basically "it's a string serialization format for some auth data A", but anything
can be auth data -->

---

### Meaningfulness

```scala
object BSEncoder {
  def apply[A](implicit ev: BSEncoder[A]): BSEncoder[A] = ev
}
implicit val encBool: BSEncoder[Boolean] = { (a: Boolean) => s"$a" }
implicit val encInt: BSEncoder[Int] = { (a: Int) => s"$a" } // ü§î
// others
```

- repetitive! 

---

### Meaningfulness

```scala mdoc:silent
object BSEncoder {
  def apply[A](implicit ev: BSEncoder[A]): BSEncoder[A] = ev
  def forShow[A: Show]: BSEncoder[A] = new BSEncoder[A] {
    def encode(a: A) = Show[A].show(a)
  }
  def forTuple[A: BSEncoder]: BSEncoder[(String, A)] = { case (s, a) =>
    s"$s=${BSEncoder[A].encode(a)}"
  }
  implicit val encInt: BSEncoder[Int] = forShow[Int]
  implicit val encBool: BSEncoder[Boolean] = forShow[Boolean]
  // others...
}
```

- and for convenience, we'll make it derivable for case classes (not shown)

```scala mdoc:invisible
implicit val encUserRole: BSEncoder[UserRole] = { role => s""""${role.toString}"""" }
implicit val encString: BSEncoder[String] = { (a: String) => s""""$a"""" }
implicit def forList[A: BSEncoder]: BSEncoder[List[A]] = (a: List[A]) =>
  a.map(BSEncoder[A].encode(_)).mkString("[", ",", "]")

implicit val hnilEncoder: BSEncoder[HNil] = { _ => "" }

implicit def lgEncoder[K <: Symbol, H, T <: HList](implicit
    witness: Witness.Aux[K],
    hEncoder: Lazy[BSEncoder[H]],
    tEncoder: BSEncoder[T]
): BSEncoder[FieldType[K, H] :: T] = { (a: H :: T) =>
  a match {
    case head :: HNil =>
      val fieldName: String = witness.value.name
      BSEncoder.forTuple[H](hEncoder.value).encode((fieldName, head))

    case head :: tail =>
      val fieldName: String = witness.value.name
      BSEncoder
        .forTuple[H](hEncoder.value)
        .encode((fieldName, head)) ++ ";" ++ BSEncoder[T]
        .encode(tail)
  }
}
implicit def genericEncoder[A, R](implicit
    gen: LabelledGeneric.Aux[A, R],
    encoder: BSEncoder[R]
): BSEncoder[A] = { a =>
  encoder.encode(gen.to(a))
}
```

```scala mdoc
BSEncoder[AuthInfo].encode(authInfo)
```

---

### Meaningfulness

- _we've done it_
- we can take arbitrary domain information in case classes and represent it in our token in a super cool and good serialization format
- so for token format we can just Deflate it and Base64 encode it and we're good to go

```scala mdoc
def toPlainTextToken[T: BSEncoder](value: T): String = {
  val deflater = new Deflater()
  val token = BSEncoder[T].encode(value)
  val tokenBytes = token.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
  deflater.setInput(tokenBytes)
  deflater.finish
  val outArray = new Array[Byte](tokenBytes.size * 2)
  val count: Int = deflater.deflate(outArray)
  Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(outArray.take(count))
}

toPlainTextToken(authInfo)
```

---

### Meaningfulness

- we've _almost_ done it -- we also have to be able to decode

<!-- going to wave hands and say "trust me it's real / works" for decoding, which it turns out is *way harder* than encoding -->

```scala mdoc:invisible
// in practice we'd want to model more specific kinds of decode errors,
// e.g. bad syntax, invalid field types, etc.

## Meaningfulness

<!-- decoding has a lot more that can go wrong -- the base64 decoding can fail if the string
is bad, the bytes might not represent a deflate-compressed object, and after that we can still
fail to decode; fortunately we're functional programmers and have nice tools available for
composing things that might fail -->
```scala mdoc
def fromPlainTextToken[T: BSDecoder](token: String): ValidatedNel[DecodeError, T] = {
  Either
    .catchNonFatal {
      val inflater = new Inflater()
      val bytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(token)
      inflater.setInput(bytes, 0, bytes.size)
      val result = Array.fill[Byte](1024)(0)
      val inflated = inflater.inflate(result)
      result.take(inflated).map(_.toChar).mkString("")

# Validity

---

## Validity

- how do we know that the claims in a token are trustworthy?
- put differently, how do we know a client with a token isn't just making things up?

--

- _signatures_

---

## Validity

- a message from *us* to *future us* about the contents of the token
- we want to be able to verify the signature, but we don't care if anyone else can verify it
- *us* and *future us* are equally trustworthy, so we can use a shared key algorithm

<!-- i.e. -- shared key means that anyone who is capable of signing is also capable of verifying
signatures and vice versa; that's bad if a user has the key, since they could then sign
arbitrary data and we'd have to treat it as good to go. however, it's not a problem to assume
that future us also has the key, since future us needs to use it to sign tokens
anyway -->

---

## Validity

- what should we sign? _whole token contents_

```scala mdoc:silent
// it should go without saying that you should absolutely not have this hardcoded in your
// codebase in real life, but I'm including this in screaming case in case some copy-pasta
// happens in your or future-me's work anyway --
// READ THIS FROM A GITIGNORED FILE OR CONFIG, ALSO THIS IS A TERRIBLE KEY
val superSecretSigningString = "very secret string key"
val keyBytes = superSecretSigningString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
val alg = "HmacSHA256"
val secret = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, alg)

def sign(s: String): String = {
  val mac = Mac.getInstance(alg)
  mac.init(secret)
  val hashed = mac.doFinal(s.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
  Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(hashed)
}
```

<!-- this sign function doesn't know anything about token-ness, it just signs arbitrary strings -->

---

## Validity

<!-- this function for creating signed tokens on the other hand knows that we're able to from
from T => our special magic token string serialization format, which is what we want to sign -->

```scala mdoc
def createSignedToken[T: BSEncoder](payload: T): String = {
  val mac = Mac.getInstance(alg)
  mac.init(secret)
  val stringPayload = toPlainTextToken(payload)
  s"$stringPayload.${sign(stringPayload)}"
}

def verifySignedToken[T: BSDecoder](token: String, signature: String): ValidatedNel[DecodeError, T] = {
  if (signature != sign(token)) {
    Validated.invalidNel(DecodeError.badSignature)
  } else {
    fromPlainTextToken[T](token)
  }
}
```

<!-- again we have kind of a lot of things that can go wrong here --
the signature might be invalid for the string that happens to kick off the token, but not every
validly signed string is a valid token, so once again we have our nice ValidatedNel to help out
and indicate that lots of things go wrong to anyone who might be trying to use this method -->

---

## Validity

```scala mdoc
val signed = createSignedToken(authInfo)
val Array(token, signature) = signed.split("\\.")

verifySignedToken[AuthInfo](token, signature)

verifySignedToken[AuthInfo](
  toPlainTextToken(AuthInfo(VanillaUser, 3, "oh no", List(19, 23, 37))),
  signature

# Token security

---

## Token security

- how do we prevent sensitive information in a token from falling into the wrong hands?
- or, how can we design tokens such that users don't accidentally reveal information they don't intend to?

--

- _encryption_

---

## Token security

- encrypted token is a message from _us_ to _someone who needs to be able to decrypt the message_ about the client's auth info
- if we're the only expected consumer of the information, then we're both producer and consumer, and it's fine to use a shared
  secret for encryption as well
- if someone else is required to consume the information, then we need to encrypt with _their_ public key
- in this case we'll pretend we're encrypting for some third party, but we'll happen to know the public and private keys

<!-- "intended recipients" and "the wrong hands" are both doing a lot of work here; who those recipients are and who has
the right hands will depend on the architecture of the token producers/consumers -->

---

## Token security

- we can encrypt at different points and different combinations of things --
- things to encrypt: payload only, signature only, both individually, entire combined token string
- for convenience with other methods I'll encrypt the whole token string here
- also for convenience / variety I'll do asymmetric encryption here, though whether it's necessary
  or helpful depends on the architecture

---

## Token security

- some keys:

```scala mdoc
def makeKeys(size: Int = 2048): (PublicKey, PrivateKey) = {
  val generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA")
  generator.initialize(size)
  val keyPair = generator.generateKeyPair()
  val publicKey = keyPair.getPublic()
  val privateKey = keyPair.getPrivate()
  (publicKey, privateKey)
}

val (publicKey, privateKey) = makeKeys()
```

---

## Token security

- encryption:

<!-- here this occurs the same place that we're creating the signed token, however it's conceivable
that some service could be responsible for creating and validating signed tokens, and another service
entirely could be responsible for handing encrypted tokens out to consumers; i.e., there's no reason
that our encrypter has to know that the thing it's encrypting started out as a T: BSEncoder -- it could
just blindly encrypt any input it gets -->

```scala mdoc
def createEncryptedToken[T: BSEncoder](payload: T): String = {
  val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA")
  cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, publicKey)  
  val plainTextToken = createSignedToken(payload)
  val encryptedTokenBytes =
    cipher.doFinal(plainTextToken.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
  Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedTokenBytes)
}
```

---

## Token security

- decryption:

<!-- in this specific implementation the signature check depends on being able to decrypt
so we're definitely in the "message from us to future us" scenario; however, there's no reason that
the signature validity check has to occur in the same application as the decryption e.g. if several
different services are creating signed tokens and encrypting them to this server's public key. there's
no reason in that case for our decrypter to know anything about what kind of token to expect, it only
needs to know how to decrypt the incoming data.

also we've now added "decryption could fail" to the list of things that can go wrong while
recovering auth info from the token. decoding is fun!
-->

```scala mdoc
def decryptToken[T: BSDecoder](token: String): ValidatedNel[DecodeError, T] = {
  val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA")
  cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey)
  Either.catchNonFatal(
    cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(token))
  )
  .leftMap(_ => DecodeError.badEncryption)
  .toValidatedNel
  .andThen { tokenBytes =>
    val tokenString = tokenBytes.map(_.toChar).mkString("")
    val Array(payload, signature) = tokenString.split("\\.").padTo(2, "")
    verifySignedToken[T](payload, signature)
  }
}
```

---

## Token security

- round trip:

```scala mdoc
val payload = AuthInfo(Admin, 28, "asdf", List(1, 2, 3, 4))
createEncryptedToken(payload)
decryptToken[AuthInfo](createEncryptedToken(payload))
```

- proof that decryption will fail with a token either encrypted by a different
  signing key or decrypted using a different private key is left to the reader

# So how'd we do?

- slightly bigger token (blame encryption / extra base64 step maybe):
  - JWT HMACSHA256 signed token of the same data: 126 characters
  - BSWT Encrypted + HMACSHA256 signed token: 173 characters

--

- way less flexible:
  - BSWT support: HMACSHA256 only for signing, RSA 2048 bit key only for encryption, key must be present at initialization
  - JWT support: big list of signing algorithms directed by header, big list of encryption algorithms directed by encryption header, support for multiple keys, support for public keys from URL

<!-- why does crypto inflexibility matter --
cryptographic arms race. hashing and encryption algorithms get defeated over time as computers get better individually /
as new attacks are discovered / as computational revolutions occur:

"Shor's algorithm can be used to break elliptic curve cryptography by computing discrete logarithms on a hypothetical quantum
computer. The latest quantum resource estimates for breaking a curve with a 256-bit modulus (128-bit security level)
are 2330 qubits and 126 billion Toffoli gates.[43] In comparison, using Shor's algorithm to break the RSA
algorithm requires 4098 qubits and 5.2 trillion Toffoli gates for a 2048-bit RSA key, suggesting that ECC is an easier
target for quantum computers than RSA. All of these figures vastly exceed any quantum computer that has ever been built,
and estimates place the creation of such computers at a decade or more away."

But also late 2021 -- IBM Eagle https://research.ibm.com/blog/127-qubit-quantum-processor-eagle gets to 127, up from 66
in  Zuchongzhi 2 (also late 2021) and 53 in Google Sycamore in 2019.
-->

- more precise expectations:
  - JWT checks token validity (signature is good, payload is JSON of any variety)
  - BSWT checks token validity + domain validity (signature is good, payload matches shape required by domain type)

<!-- tsec https://jmcardon.github.io/tsec/docs/http4s/auth-jwt.html also has explicit expectations about types -->

<!-- similar in Servant if you use servant auth -- there's a typeclass for "I expect to be able to decode this from
the payload of a JWT" which you can derive for free with ToJSON / FromJSON instances, and it's required on any route
with JWT auth in its type -->

- barely a web token since maybe not url-safe ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<!-- depending on input -- some inputs will give us slashes or other unsafe characters in the encoded token;
this isn't a problem unless you're using the token in a query parameter, but still, and also can be handled by
a string replace on the resulting string -->

Components of JWTs and considerations about validation and encryption were sourced from the [Auth0 JWT book](https://auth0.com/resources/ebooks/jwt-handbook),
which you can have for free if you're willing to receive some marketing emails for the rest of your life.

All Pokemon imagery via Bulbapedia, where the authors believe use of the imagery is covered under fair use.
I believe the same about the use of the imagery here but I am not a lawyer.

Also cryptography is really hard? If you think your'e really solid on explaining different cryptosystems and
situations where you may want to prioritize different features, uhhh maybe there should be a mentoring session
on that (I'd sign up).
